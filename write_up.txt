To determine the homography between images, we used SIFT to find key points, given its fairly good performance in the light of scaling and rotation and handles occlusion and image cluttering quite well.
BFMatcher was recommended by Dr. Klinger, as a good toolkist to calculate distance between the descriptors produced from SIFT, using the l^2 norm as the distance measure that the K-nearest neighbors algorithm used to do feature matching.  To filter out matches, we used Lowe's ratio test, which is commonly used.  After finding our filtered matches set, we formed the source and destination point sets and then passed them to findHomography which found our homography matrix.

Our image generation script generates a 3 image panorama of our second home, the 2nd floor lab in GDC.  We stitched the middle and left images and then the middle and right images using our defined homography, warp_image, and create_mosaic functions.
